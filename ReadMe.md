Welcome to my Biml Demos.

This is where you can find the code from any of my current presentations. Feel free to submit [issues](https://github.com/shannonlowder/Biml/issues) you find in my demos.  I'm also open to requests for new demos.  Just let me know what you'd like to see!

[Interrogator](http://shannonlowder.com/biml-interrogator-demo/) -- extract metadata from your data sources. This is most helpful for dealing with your flat files.  [Read more] (http://shannonlowder.com/biml-interrogator-demo/) on how to use the project.

There are now two projects for Interrogator. One is for BimlStudio, the other is for BimlExpress.  The BimlExpress version uses links to files in the BimlStudio project.  That way, we have a single codebase for both solutions.

[DataTypeConversion](http://toyboxcreations.net/datatype-conversion-utility-for-biml/) -- need to convert back and forth between Biml, SQL Server, and SSIS datatypes?  Get my utility in this repo!
